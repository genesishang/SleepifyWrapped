# Sleepify Wrapped
## About
Inspired by the annually released Spotify Wrapped, we aimed to create a program that summarizes sleep schedules and quality. We centered our programming decisions around the data available to us. Using 9 months of a [Kaggle user's Apple Health data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aeryss/apple-health-sleep-stages-and-heart-rate?resource=download), we identified four primary sleep categories (as tracked by Apple Watch devices): Awake, Light/Core, Deep, and REM.

| ----------- | ----------- |
| Awake | Title |
| Light/Core | Text |
| Deep | Title |
| REM | Text |

Sleepify Wrapped informs the user on the average number of hours slept in each category as well as the average heart rate (BPM) for each category. Why is this useful? We know adults should get at least 7 hours of sleep every night, but many people who reach this goal continue to feel unrested. That's where our program proves useful: it combines lesser-known knowledge of sleep cycles with the user's personal data, helping them pinpoint the underlying problem. For example, people whose REM sleep is continuously disrupted may find it more difficult

## Ethical Considerations
As college students with no medical background, we want to make it abundantly clear that this program should not be used to diagnose sleep disorders. In addition to summarizing datta in a concise and useful manner, it is purely meant to democratize knowledge on sleep quality and how it affects all of us in our daily lives.

## Future Directions
As a group, we had 12 hours to code this project. With the time constraint, we
